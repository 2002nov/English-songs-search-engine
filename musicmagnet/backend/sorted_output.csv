See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns. See you make your way through the crowd. And say, ""Hello"". Little did I kno  That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles. And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"". And I was crying on the staircase. Begging you, ""Please don't go"". And I said. ""Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess. It's a love story, baby, just say yes"". So I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew. So close your eyes. Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh. 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter. And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"". But you were everything to me. I was begging you, ""Please don't go"". And I said. ""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess. It's a love story, baby, just say yes"". Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult, but it's real. Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story, baby, just say yes. Oh, oh-oh. I got tired of waiting. Wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in you was fading. When I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said. ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you, but you never come. Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"". He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring. And said. ""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone. I love you, and that's all I really know. I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress. It's a love story, baby, just say yes"". Oh, oh-oh.

11,Don't,Ed Sheeran,2014,Pop/R&B,"Ah lahmlahlah Ah lahmlahlah. I met this girl late last year. She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear.""  I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake. I called an old friend thinking. that the trouble would wait. But then I jump right in. A week later returned. I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn. But I gave her my time for two or three nights. Then I put it on pause until the moment was right. I went away for months until our paths crossed again. She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend.  Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00.  Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin.  We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM. Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said.""  She's singing  Ah lahmlahlah. Don't fuck with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my home. I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah. Don't fuck with my love. I told her she knows. Take aim and reload. I don't wanna know that babe. Ah lahmlahlah. And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her. We drink away the days with a take-away pizza. Before a text message was the only way to reach her. Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her. Singing out Aretha. All over the track like a feature. And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either. But me and her we make money the same way. Four cities, two planes the same day. And those shows have never been what it's about. But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out. I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch. But we should get on a plane. Or we'll be missing it now. Wish I'd have written it down. The way that things played out. When she was kissing him. How I was confused about. Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing. Ah lahmlahlah. Don't fuck with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my home. I don't wanna know that babe. Ah lahmlahlah. Don't fuck with my love. I told her she knows. Take aim and reload. I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah. [Knock knock knock] on my hotel door. I don't even know if she knows what for. She was crying on my shoulder. I already told ya. Trust and respect is what we do this for. I never intended to be next. But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all. And I never saw him as a threat. Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course. It's not like we were both on tour. We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor. And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment. But it was never just fun and I thought you were different. This is not the way you realize what you wanted. It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest. And all this time God knows. I'm singing Ah lahmlahlah. Don't fuck with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my home. I don't wanna know that babe. Ah lahmlahlah. Don't fuck with my love. I told her she knows. Take aim and reload. I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah.","200,627,169"

70,Where,Finding Hope,2017,Electronic/Ambient,"I can see it's been a while. Why was it that you left me. Cuz with you, I'm like a child. And now I feel so lost and empty. I can see it in your eyes. It's like I'm standing here in limbo. If only you can tell me why. Instead of guessing through this window. Where did you go?  Where did you go, baby?  I should've known. I should've known, lately  You've been acting real funny. Are you keeping something from me. Are you going, are you coming?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?   Where did you go?   Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  By the end of the night. Wish that I could hear your voice again. This is killing me inside. I wish that I could have that choice again. And the feeling is always right. If you were with me, I'd rejoice again  Girl I've got nothing to hide. If only you could make some noise again. Where did you go?  Where did you go, baby?  I should've known. I should have known, lately. You've been acting real funny. Are you keeping something from me. Are you goin', are you coming?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?  Where did you go?

90,Understand,Keshi,2020,Pop/Alternative R&B,"Never thought that I'd find. That the one in my life would be so near. And now you're here. I got you, you got me. When it's us, babe, you make me feel complete. You're all I need. Ooh, ooh.Maybe we can try it if you let me  Take you by the hand. You're the only one who understands. So I guess that it's time. I asked you to be mine for all my days. I hope you'll stay. I'll admit that I'm scared. 'Cause I've never really cared as much as this. It's worth the risk.Ooh, ooh  Maybe we can try it if you let me. Take you by the hand.You're the only one who understands  Ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh. Maybe we can try it if you let me.

69,Paths,Finding Hope,2017,Electronic/Ambient,"There's static on the radio. And I missed the exit miles ago. Life is feeling like a lonely road. And now I'm nothing like I was before. You push and pull to make a point to fall away from you (I)  But I only found the disappointment in the wild blue (sky). And I can't escape the broken path that's leading back to you (I). Can't accept the thought of fading out. So I came home. Even though I could move on I know there's hope for you and I. So I came home. Can't be far from you for long. Every path is leading back to. Back to you and I.  Back to you and I. Back to, back to. Back to you and I. Back to, Back to. I'm under every influence. And this ain't making any sense. Smoke is falling heavy in this room of blank faces. Anxiety and I'm missing you So I came home Even though. I could move on. I know there's hope for you and I.  So I came home (came home). Can't be far from you for long. Every path is leading back to. Back to you and I. Back to you and I. Back to, back to. Back to you and I. Back to, back to. Gotta gotta get back to you. Lover nothing that I can do. Gotta gotta get back to you. Lover nothing that I can do, can do. Nothing I can do","439,929"
